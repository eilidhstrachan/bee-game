Oh thank goodness! You're here to help us get the bees back, right?
I'm Beatrice, or Bea for short. 
I work as a beekeeper, we're all really struggling without the bees.
You'll be able to get them back though! I believe in you.
Or, bee-lieve ha ha ha... 
Sorry, I'll let you get on. Oh, but if you have any questions about bees, feel free to come and ask me!
