Thanks for your help with my homework!
Oh yeah, I promised to tell you what I heard. 
Well, there's this guy who lives down that weird path who HATES bees. I overheard him shouting the other day.
"Damn you bee! Bee is the worst! Oh bee..." he was saying! 
+[Are you sure?]
Yeah! Maybe was so angry that he forgot to say bees instead of bee. Or maybe there was just one bee that he was really upset at!
But I know what I heard. I may not be good at maths, but I have a perfect memory!
+[Sounds like he hates bees.]
Right! It has to be him. But he saw me listening to him shouting and made me promise not to tell anyone so...
Don't tell anyone! Or he might turn me into a frog. Yuck!
