Hi! Hey, you must be that detective my mum was talking about. Please find out what happened to the bees! I miss them.

What are you looking at? My outfit? Why does no one understand my genius plan to help bring the bees back...
I'm dressed like a bee so they'll feel less scared about coming back to the village! Its smart, right?
 ** [So smart!]
 Thank you! bzz bzz bzz, where are you guys? 
 ** [Uh... well...]
 Ugh, all you grown ups are the same. I'll show you!
