Hey there! Welcome to our humble farm.
Yeah, it really doesn't look like much now, does it?
I swear, we're usually bustling with crops, but...
Well, without the bees to pollinate everything, we've not been having much luck recently. At least the chickens didn't up and fly off too!
Also, don't mind my husband, he's very stressed out just now. I am too of course, but lets just say we're opposites when it comes to working under pressure.
See you around.
