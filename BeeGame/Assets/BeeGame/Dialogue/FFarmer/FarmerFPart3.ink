You've moved your investigation on towards the city huh? You're definitely onto something there.
Most of those city folks are nice enough, but the big CEO's that live in their fancy buildings couldn't care less about a small town like ours...
It wouldn't surprise me if one of them was behind the bees disappearing. 
The supermarket is kind enough to stock some of our produce alongside some of the bigger farm's stuff, so we can't fault them I guess.
