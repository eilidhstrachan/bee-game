Hey there! I'm Flora. 
Nice to meet you! I don't know if the mayor told you in his letter, but I'm a florist. I'm pretty much an expert in flowers, so if you need any help with flower related stuff then I'm your gal. 
You're probably wondering; why haven't they sent Flora to go find more flowers hm? Well let me tell you, I have a terrible sense of direction! I already tried to go out looking for them but I got lost. 
To be honest there's probably even some around the village that I've missed... Anyways, if you find any, we'll plant them in that garden over beside the cottage and fingers crossed they'll start to attract the bees back!
I see you brought a notebook with you? If you want, you should keep note of all the flowers you've collected in it! 
That way, you can learn more about each flower. It might look a bit empty just now, but before long hopefully it'll be filled with information about flowers.
You'll have a whole encyclopaedia! It'll be a great way of keeping track of which ones you've already collected.
Best of luck, I'll see you around!
