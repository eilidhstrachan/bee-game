Nice to meet you! I'm Gordon.
I work as a gardener here in the village.
Although, with all the flowers & plants gone, I've not had much work to do.
But you're gonna help out with that, right? Thank you detective!
Once you find some flowers, we'll plant them in this here garden! Hopefully we'll see some bees before long too.
