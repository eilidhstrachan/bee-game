Have you seen the garden? The flowers you found have brought some bees back! Only a few mind you, but wow! 
Bea and Flora said it would work, but it's so cool actually seeing some bees back in that garden.
I can't wait to see it full of flowers again, I've missed getting to look after the village garden.
