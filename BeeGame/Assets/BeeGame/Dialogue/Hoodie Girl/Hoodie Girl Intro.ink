Hello.
You're that detective right? The outfit is a dead giveaway.
Well I'm glad you're here to help out, there's definitely been some strange stuff going on lately.
Did you see that book over on that small hill just behind where we're standing? If not, go have a look, like I said - very strange stuff happening.
I think I might've even found a clue related to it, but I can't figure it out. If you wanna help, go have a look at that book and then come back and talk to me.
