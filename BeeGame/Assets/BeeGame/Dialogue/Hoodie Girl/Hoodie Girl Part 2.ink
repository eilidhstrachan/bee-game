Have you seen that kid over there in the bee costume?
It's sweet, but he really does think he's the reason the bees are starting to come back.
He said something to me about how he knows why the bees disappeared, you don't think maybe he actually does know something? Maybe he really does.
Anyways, he wouldn't tell me about it, whatever it is. Maybe you'll have more luck!
