We did it! Let's see...
It says something about a "vanishing spell"? I must've been right! It has to be the missing page from that magic book we saw!
Oh wait, it says this spell doesn't actually make things vanish, it just makes the object/person that you're trying to make disappear teleport anywhere from a couple of miles away to hundreds of miles away.
Pff, those witches & wizards haven't came up with a way to make things actually vanish?
You don't think someone used this spell on the bees, right?
+[Maybe they did.]
But why! Those poor bees, I hope they're all together and not on their own somewhere.
+[Nah, no way!]
Surely! What good would that do? But why did they rip it up and try to put it in the bin?
