Detective! Oh precious wonderful detective. You've saved our business! Look at those perfect crops that have started to grow.
I can't believe even a few bees have made such a difference. I can't wait till they're all back home! I should go and thank them.
Wait, how does one thank a bee?
Maybe I'll go ask Beatrice.
