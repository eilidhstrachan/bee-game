Detective! You made it! Thank you for coming at such short notice. I'm the mayor of Sunset Village, the very same one that sent you that letter!
We know this probably isn't the sort of case you're used to dealing with, but we're at our wits end here...
We really thought the bees would be back before long, but waiting it out just isn't cutting it anymore. It's a shame really, we didn't realise how important they were to all our livelihoods and now they're gone.
But I have faith! I just know you'll be able to find out what happened to them. The circumstances are certainly very suspicious, but I'm sure if you ask around the other townsfolk, they'll tell you what they know.
Anyways, good luck! Oh, and if you've got the time, me and Gordon, our lovely gardener, have a few "puzzles" of sort that you might be able to help out with.
