Detective! How are you getting on? Is that scrapbook of yours starting to fill up?
I can't believe there were flowers just sitting around the village and none of us noticed!
Just as well we've got you around now haha.
Did you manage to help Gordon by the way? I know he would really appreciate it if you could!
