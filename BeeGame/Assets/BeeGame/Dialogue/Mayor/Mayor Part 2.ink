So I take it you've been exploring outside the village now, yes?
If not, I recommend you go and have a look. Just head over that bridge to the East side of the village.
I'd be surprised if there weren't a fair number of flowers scattered around there! Maybe there will even be some clues for this mystery. 
You're making great progress so far, keep it up detective!
