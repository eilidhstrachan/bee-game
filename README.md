# bee-game
My Unity 2D RPG game for the AC31009 - Games Programming module

All code is currently in the Assets/Scripts folder.

Sources for assets I used that I didn't make myself are in the AssetSources text file.

To run the game, download the zip file called BeeDetective.zip here on github in the main branch, extract those files and then run the "Bee Detective" application file. This build should work on all windows PCs running 32 bit or above.
